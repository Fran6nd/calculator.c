# calculator.c
A simple command-line calculator calculating expressions.<br>
It is not really accurate since we are doing multiplications and divisions first... but it's enough for most of the use cases :)<br>
# #keepitsimple

Examples:

* `./calculator "2*sin((-1+2))"` will output `1.682942`
* `./calculator "(4*(4*4))"` will output `64.000000`
